If you are planning to BUILD an installation (most people don't need to)
then read CommonBuildResources/INSTALLATIONBUILDING first.

MacOSX builders can go straight to MacOSX/README_BUILD_MACOS.html. You
might wonder why that text used to be in .rtf form. So did I.

Bernard -> Bernard: on Spartacus you can build the GUI in Linux, then
switch to the Win7 VM to do the engine build before building
the distribution jar. I've not bothered to automate the entire
Windows build, though it may only require me to install ant and javac 
in Win7.
