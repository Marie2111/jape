1. Get the developer tools (from Apple or from a CD).

2. Double-click MacOSX/java_GUI/Jape.pbproj (it's an Xcode project file)

3. It will make a directory MacOSX/java_GUI/build, in which there will be a file Jape.app

4. In a terminal window, cd to MacOSX/java_GUI/build, execute

    ln -s ../../../camlengine/jape jape_engine
    open Jape.app

5. enjoy

6. tell me how to do it from the command line, if you know.
