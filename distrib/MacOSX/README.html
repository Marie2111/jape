<h1>Jape Readme</h1>

<p>Readme for jape v7_d9 (and some later
versions: you can discover the precise version by looking at
the Jape splash screen, or it's in the console window, on
the first line).</p> 

<p><b>1. What's different?</b></p> 

<p>Logic encodings have to declare their
intention to allow multiple hypothesis selection (and at
present only natural deduction and Hoare logic do that, so
you can now only make single hypothesis selections in all
other encodings).</p> 

<p>It has proven too difficult to maintain the
technology needed to produce Universal binaries; we now do
only Intel binaries.<span
class="Apple-converted-space"></span></p> <p>Jape
works on Snow Leopard and Lion on intel machines, and may
well work on Mountain Lion (we would be interested to
know).</p>  

<p>Some reorganisation of code so that it's
possible to develop with Eclipse.</p> 

<p>Some minor bugs fixed in the Hoare logic
encoding.</p> 

<p><b>2. Beware!</b></p> 

<p>Usual moans.</p> 

<p>2.1. It will have bugs. Life is like that. But
it doesn't have many bugs ...</p> 

<p>2.2. Please, please, please report bugs,
deficiencies, infelicities and moans to
richard@bornat.me.uk</p> 

<p>2.3. We develop and run on the latest Mac OS X
on intel hardware. If it doesn't work for you on a less
modern system, please let us know.</p> 

<p><b>3. Installation</b></p> 

<p>3.1 Copy the application and the examples
folder anywhere you like.</p> 

<p><b>4. Font installation</b></p> 

<p>4.1 Jape runs straight out of the box using
the fonts which come with OS X. These days many available
fonts have all the glyphs we need.</p> 

<p><b>5. Launching</b></p>

<p>5.1 Double-click Jape, then use the File menu
to open a theory (.jt) file. (We are working on
reconstituting the appropriate behaviour when you drop a
theory file on a Jape icon)</p> 

<p><b>6. Editing examples files</b></p> 

<p>Unicode editing ought to be easy on Mac OS X:
long term support for funny fonts, font fall-through
implemented so that even if your font doesn't have the
turnstile glyph, <i>some</i> font has it, so you can see it
even if you are editing in Courier and think you are looking
at ASCII. But there's many a slip ...</p> 

<p>First of all you must have a decent Unicode
font (see above). But you've already done that, cos you
can't run Jape without it.</p> 

<p>The best text editor that I know for OS X is
BBEdit: it's not free, but it works and it writes the
(unnecessary but very useful) Unicode BOM at the front of
the file.</p> 

<p>TextEdit is free and it works well with Lucida
Sans Unicode, but it doesn't have any search facility.
Oddly, it will recognise and respect a BOM on input but it
won't write one on output. Still, at least it's still UTF-8
when you've finished.</p> 

<p>The best editor, so far as appearance,
respecting BOMs and the like is concerned, is XCode. Drop
your examples files on XCode (it's free from Apple, provided
you are prepared to 'register as a developer' -- i.e. give
them your email and a password -- but it takes an age to
download). It reads and writes BOMs properly, so far as I
can tell. It shows you all the glyphs in whatever font. Only
oddity is that the files I have created in XCode have come
out in UTF-16. Jape deals with that, but it confuses CVS
mightily. Oh well: at least the encoder I distribute
translates the files.</p> 

<p>Actually the TeXShop editor gets Unicode
fallthrough right. Ho hum.</p> 

<p>No doubt this situation will improve. It all
seems mighty silly to me.</p> 

<p><b>7. Feedback</b></p> 

<p>7.1. Please mail Richard lots (see 2.2 above).</p>


<p>7.2 If it doesn't work for you, it doesn't
work. Tell Richard (I don't say please -- just do it!).</p>


<p>7.3 If it doesn't do what you want it to, tell
Richard.</p>
