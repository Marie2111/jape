Bugs:

-----------------

pane focus is invisible;
means of setting focus is lame (do it through JapeCanvas abstract item claimFocus());
cache of various Undo/Redo actions not reaching GUI properly (rethink).

Cancel in choose file dialog after Save/Cancel/Don'tSave shouldn't mean Don'tSave

panel maximise button

why does Konstanz have such descent measurement?

Windows menu

Localise file dialogs

PanelWindow needs to use minwaste to pack buttons

We can do writing in windows behind the front (if careful)
