<h1>Font problems in BAN logic encoding</h1>
<p>
Some of the characters used in the BAN logic encoding aren't in widely-available Unicode fonts, and one of them ('says' -- looks a bit like |~) doesn't correspond a single Unicode glyph. This has a severe effect in Linux, Solaris and Windows, and a mild effect in MacOS X (but watch this space :-)).
</p>
<h1>BAN on Linux, Solaris and Windows</h1>
<p>All the machines we have used are missing or not correctly displaying at least the symbols used in the first four menus (believes, sees, says, and whatever the
bar-with-double-arrow is called).
</p>

<h1>BAN on MacOS X</h1>

<p>
The panels and menus in MacOS X Jape at present use the Konstanz font used in
MacOS (Classic) Jape, so they work properly.  The menu and window <i>titles</i>
are rendered in Unicode, however, and that means that the first four menu titles at least (believes, sees, says, and whatever the
bar-with-double-arrow is called) look a bit wonky. (If you're missing more than that, OpenType fonts with lots of characters are available semi-piratically on the web: we aren't telling you where ...)
</p>

<h1>So when are we going to fix it?</h1>

<p>
These problems won't be permanently fixed until there is a widely available freeware
universal Unicode font.  One's coming, we believe, from ESSTIX.  Watch the
skies!
</p>

<h1>How about a workaround?</h1>

<p>
If you are desperate to work in BAN logic on <b><i>Linux</i></b> or <b><i>Solaris</i></b>, the v5 distribution of Jape, available from <a href="http://users.comlab.ox.ac.uk/bernard.sufrin/jape.html">the Oxford Jape site</a> still works fine. If you need to work in <b><i>Windows</i></b>, we've included a BAN_ASCII.jt encoding that uses multi-character sequences to represent the BAN glyphs (but look out: proofs you produce with it won't be readable under the normal BAN encoding). 'Believes' is |=-; 'sees' is <|; 'says' is |~; and the other thing is |=>.</p>

<h1>Email us!</h1>

<p>
If the BAN_ASCII encoding is still a bit too rich for your machine, send a screenshot to <a href="mailto:bugs@www.jape.org.uk">bugs@www.jape.org.uk</a>, and we'll go the extra mile for you. But no complaints about split infinitives, if you want a helpful reply.</p>
