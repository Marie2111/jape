<h1>BAN on Linux and Windows</h1>

<p>At present the symbols of BAN logic are not well supported in available
Unicode fonts.  We are missing or not correctly displaying the symbols used in
the first four menus (believes, sees, says, and whatever the
bar-with-double-arrow is called).
</p>

<h1>BAN on MacOS X</h1>

<p>
The panels and menus in MacOS X Jape at present use the Konstanz font used in
MacOS (Classic) Jape, so they work properly.  The menu and window <i>titles</i>
are rendered in Unicode, however, and depending on the fonts available on your
machine, you will probably find that some of the titles look wrong.
</p>

<h1>So when are we going to fix it?</h1>

<p>
These problems won't easily be fixed, until there is a widely available freeware
universal Unicode font.  One's coming, we believe, from ESSTIX.  Watch the
skies, because until it comes BAN logic will be effectively inaccessible in Jape
on Linux and Windows, and a little tricky to use in MacOS X.
