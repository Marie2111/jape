Windows (2K and XP) Jape installation
==========================================
December 2003
=============


You will need
-------------

        A functioning java (1.4 or later) system. Sun's standard jre
        for windows (available at www.javasoft.com) is good enough --
        you don't need the java development kit.
        
        A (shallow) knowledge of how to run a command from a command
        window opened in a particular folder.

What to do
----------

0. Decide where you want Jape's home to be on your system

1. Unpack the distribution jar file in Jape's home with

        jar -xvf $(OS)jape.jar

   This unpacks the examples directory, and leaves the inference
   engine (jape.engine -- architecture dependent), the interface
   server (japeserver.jar -- architecture independent), and an
   installation program (installjape.jar -- should be architecture and
   OS independent).

   TROUBLESHOOTING: If you don't have java installed, and the java
   commands on your path, then this will not work. Do whatever you
   need to do to get java installed and on your path. You don't need
   the whole jdk, just the java runtime environment.

2. Now complete the installation with

        java -jar installjape.jar

   This latter script builds the file jape.cmd into which the path to
   Java's home is bound. You can make shortcuts to the jape.cmd
   script from anywhere in your filestore. If you wish to change
   Jape's home, then you will have to edit this file, or run
   installjape.jar again from the new home.

   TROUBLESHOOTING: there should be no problems here. This part of
   the process  will abort if (for some reason) there's no java
   command on your path, but were that so, then you couldn't have
   unpacked the jar in the first place.

3. Try running jape by double-clicking on jape.cmd
   then selecting (for example) the theory file

        examples/sequent_calculus/SCS.jt

4. Please let us know that you've succeeded (or failed) by sending a short
   message of triumph (or despair) to

        japeinstall@jape.org.uk

   In case of despair, please send a log of your installation session and
   the attempted run of jape.        

That's all there is to it.
