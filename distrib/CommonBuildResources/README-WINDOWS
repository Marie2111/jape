Windows (2K and XP) Jape installation
==========================================
January 2003 (Revision 2)
============


You will need
-------------

        A functioning java (1.4 or later) system. Sun's standard jre
        for windows (available at www.javasoft.com) is good enough --
        you don't need the java development kit.

What to do
----------

0. Decide where you want Jape's home to be on your system, and move
   the $(OS)jape.jar file there

1. Open $(OS)jape.jar by double clicking on it, or other means. This
   will start executing the interactive java installer.

   This brings up a Splash Screen on which there are two buttons
   and a log window. Press the button labelled "Install Jape Now".

   This starts the jape installer, which unpacks the examples
   directory, and leaves the inference engine (jape.engine --
   architecture dependent), the interface server (japeserver.jar
   -- architecture independent), and an installation program
   (installjape.class -- should be architecture and OS independent).
   It then runs the installation program, which builds 
   a command file (jape.cmd) into which the path to
   Jape's home is bound, and a shortcut (Jape) to that command file. 
   You can copy the shortcut to anywhere in your filestore, and run
   it from there.

   TROUBLESHOOTING: If you don't have java installed then this
   will not work. Do whatever you need to do to get java installed
   and on your path. You don't need the whole jdk, just the java
   runtime environment (jre -- obtainable from www.javasoft.com)


2. Try running jape by double-clicking on jape.cmd
   then pressing "File/Open New Theory" and
   selecting (for example) the theory file

        examples/sequent_calculus/SCS.jt

   [[Do not press File/Open  -- there's a small bug (with big consequences)
    in the Windows java implementation]]

3. Please let us know that you've succeeded (or failed) by sending a short
   message of triumph (or despair) to

        japeinstall@jape.org.uk

   In case of despair, please send a log of your installation session and
   the attempted run of jape.
