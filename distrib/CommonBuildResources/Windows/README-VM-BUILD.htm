I built a windows installer for Jape using a VMWare Windows XP 
and the current <a href="http://protz.github.com/ocaml-installer/">
MinGW-based native Win32 port of Ocaml</a> that I found
at <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/release.en.html">the OCaml release site</a>.
</p>

<p>
First I installed the OCaml release, along with the Cygwin infrastructure
it carries with it, on the VM (the running VMware virtual machine). 
This took about ten minutes, and I had to respond in a fairly obvious way 
to a couple of prompts from the installer. You probably don't need the
TCL installation, but I didn't know that I didn't so I told the installer to
go aead with that, too. 
</p>


<p>
The VM  shares my home directory on the host machine's filestore. It's
known to Cygwin as <tt>/cygdrive/z</tt>. Below I assume that the
SourceForge  material is in the host machine's filestore as 
<tt>~/JapeForge/distrib</tt>.

<pre>
HOST:   cd ~/JapeForge/distrib
HOST:   sh CommonBuildResources/buildbuild.sh
HOST:   cd WindowsJape/build
HOST:   make GUI

        wait until Java GUI files have been compiled
        
VM:     (Run the cygwin terminal from the Windows start menu)       
VM:     cd /cygdrive/z/JapeForge/WindowsJape/build
VM:     make engine

        wait (a couple of minutes) until jape.exe has been made
        it will appear in ../../camlengine/_buildWindows

HOST:   make jarfile

        this will constuct InstallWindowsJape.jar as required.
