What to do
----------

0. Decide where you want Jape's home to be on your system, and move
   the $(OS)jape.jar file there

1. From an X window terminal in that directory unpack the
   distribution jar file in Jape's home with

        java -jar $(OS)jape.jar

   This will start executing the interactive java installer.
   
   The installer brings up a Splash Screen on which there are
   three buttons and a log window. 

           If you have downloaded the jar file to your desktop
           or home directory you are STRONGLY ADVISED to select
           a folder before pressing the Install button.  You can
           do this by pressing the "Choose Folder" button -- this
           brings up a folder selection dialogue.

2. Press the button labelled "Install".

   This starts the jape installer, which unpacks the examples
   directory, and leaves the inference engine (jape.engine --
   architecture dependent), the interface server (japeserver.jar
   -- architecture independent), and an installation script
   (installjape.sh -- should be architecture and OS independent).
   It then runs the installation script, which builds two
   shellscripts (jape, and japeserver) into which the path to
   Jape's home is bound. You can make symbolic or other links to
   the jape script from anywhere in your filestore. If you wish
   to change Jape's home, then you will have to edit these files,
   or run the script installjape.sh again from the new home.

   TROUBLESHOOTING: If you don't have java installed, and the java
   commands on your path, then this will not work. Do whatever you
   need to do to get java installed and on your path. You don't need
   the whole jdk, just the java runtime environment.


3. Try running jape, by (for example)

        ./jape examples/sequent_calculus/SCS.jt

4. Please let us know that you've succeeded (or failed) by sending a short
   message of triumph (or despair) to

        japeinstall@jape.org.uk

   In case of despair, please send a log of your installation session and
   the attempted run of jape.
