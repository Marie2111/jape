1. BACKGROUND

RELEVANT STATIC DIRECTORY STRUCTURE FOR Jape 6 with Java GUI

+jape
|
+-+camlengine
|   -- OCAML sources for the proof engine
|
+-+CommonBuildResources 
| |   -- common make files, common distribution technology sources,
| |   -- common README files, Licenses, etc.
| |
| +-+Linux
| |   -- OS-specific Make that expects to be used from ../LinuxJape/build
| |
| +-+Solaris
| |   -- OS-specific Make that expects to be used from ../SolarisJape/build
| |
| +-+Windows
|     -- OS-specific Make that expects to be used from ../WindowsJape/build
|
+-+examples
|   -- various directories containing theories
| 
+-+java_japeserver
    -- Java sources for the GUI

TEMPORARY STRUCTURE THAT CAN BE REMOVED AND REBUILT AS NECESSARY 
FROM CommonBuildResources BY
     FOREACH OS IN Linux Solaris Windows
     DO      mkdir ../$(OS)Jape ../$(OS)Jape/build
             cp    $(OS)/Make ../$(OS)Jape/build 
             cd    ../$(OS)Jape/build
             ln -s ../../examples .
     DONE

THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES HAVE YET TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE BUILD SYSTEM

2. Rebuild and populate the abovementioned $(OS)Jape structures

3a. FROM A SOLARIS MACHINE IN THE jape DIRECTORY
    cd SolarisJape/build
    make distribution
    -- this completes without intervention, leaving you with SolarisJape.jar
   
3b. FROM A LINUX MACHINE IN THE jape DIRECTORY
    cd LinuxJape/build
    make distribution
    -- this completes without intervention, leaving you with LinuxJape.jar

3c. FROM A UNIX (Solaris or Linux) MACHINE IN THE jape DIRECTORY (AT OXFORD)
    cd WindowsJape/build
    make distribution
    -- this completes with just one intervention -- namely the
       execution of a build file on a windows machine
       connected to the same filestore, leaving you with WindowsJape.jar
