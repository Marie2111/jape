The resources in this directory may be useful if you plan to use
jEdit to edit Jape theory files.

The JAPETaskBar macro starts a task bar that supports convenient
insertion of Unicoded (mathematical) material. The palette of
symbols can very easily be edited to meet a user's needs.

Installation:

        JAPELibrary.bsh -- should be placed in the jedit startup
        directory

        JAPETaskBar.bsh -- should be placed in (or under) the jedit
        macro directory
