<h3>News</h3>

<p>The Jape implementation has been ported (by Richard Bornat) from SML of
New Jersey to OCAML, and all versions now use the same front-end, namely
Richard's Java-written GUI.</p>

<p>Implementations are currently available for MacOsX, Solaris (sparc), Linux
(x86), and Windows (2K, NT, XP), and all will eventually be distributed from
this site.</p>

<p>The distributions are around 600kb in size and you will need to have a
functioning Java 2 implementation (preferably Sun's JDK or JRE in a version
later than 1.3) before you can do the installation. Once you have one of
these, installation is done by executing a <tt>jar</tt> file -- a one-command
operation on Unixoid systems and a one-click operation on Windows. </p>

<h3>Caution</h3>

<p>The present distributions  are of late alpha quality,  in the following
senses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Whilst the main functionality of Jape is present, there are a number of
    slight bugs and omissions  in the user interface. To the best of our
    knowledge the bugs all result in mild irritation to the user, rather than
    death of the application.</li>
  <li>It lacks up to date documentation. Much of the existing documentation
    of particular theories can, in the proper hands, and with some caution,
    be reused. To the best of our knowledge the interfaces to most of the
    example theories are fully functional, although a detail of the text
    selection interface has changed.(The Control-key must be pressed to make
    second and subsequent text selections)</li>
  <li>We have not retrotested all the distributed theories completely.</li>
  <li>The Laura encoding hasn't yet been implemented.</li>
  <li>We no longer bundle with the distribution an editor that can cope with
    the text encodings used in the example theories. (One is available on
    request, but we don't have time to support it)</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>We are, of course, working to remedy these defects.</p>
