Welcome to the Jape distribution

To install Jape on MacOS X, collect the .dmg file, mount it with Disk Copy and do what the README in the mounted image says.

To install Jape on Linux/Solaris/Windows, collect the appropriate .jar file and README
for your operating system, then do what the README says. 

CAVEAT (Jan/9/2003): There has been a report of the Unix installer
not showing all its buttons when run remotely on Solaris. At the
moment Bernard cannot explain this phenomenon.  It's safest to run the
installer on the machine that it's doing the installation on.
