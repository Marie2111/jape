Welcome to the Jape distribution

To install Jape, collect a .jar file and the appropriate README
for your operating system, then do what the README says. 

CAVEAT (Jan/9/2003): There has been a report of the Unix installer
not showing all its buttons when run remotely on Solaris. At the
moment I cannot explain this phenomenon.  It's safest to run the
installer on the machine that it's doing the installation on.

        * Added Laura encoding (used only in JnJ examples as
        far as we know)

        we can make it settable from the interface or theory)
