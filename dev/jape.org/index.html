<h2 align="center">Breaking News</h2>

<P>
(May 2004) <b>Jape theory files now use Unicode</b>. 
You may use any of the conventional Unicode encodings (UTF8, UTF16, ...).
Support for transcoding existing theories in the old Konstanz or Laura
encodings is provided in the release.
</P>

<p>
<b>We've released the Jape source</b>. Don't ask why it took so long; definitely don't ask why the engine is such a complicated mess; just enjoy the liberty to browse through our dirty washing. And contribute, if you wish, to tidying it up. We'd like it if you sent your improvements back to us to be incorporated in future releases, of course. (We may soon put Jape on an open-source site; we haven't decided which; advice welcome.)
</p>

<h2 align="center">Old News</h2>

<p>The Jape implementation has been ported (by Richard Bornat) from SML of
New Jersey to OCAML, and all versions now use the same front-end, namely
Richard's Java-written GUI.</p>

<p>Implementations are currently available for Mac OS X, Solaris (sparc), Linux
(x86), and Windows (2K, NT, XP).</p>

<p>The distributions are around 600kb in size. Java is built into MacOSX; for other OSs you will need to have a functioning Java 2 implementation (preferably Sun's JDK or JRE, version 1.3.1 or later) before you can do the installation. Once you have one of these, installation is done by executing a <tt>jar</tt> file -- a one-command operation on Unixoid systems and a one-click operation on Windows.
</p>

<p>
Jape is a work in progress. 
<ul>
	<li>The port from the earlier SML version, and different interfaces on different machines, is still incomplete. That's because Richard wanted to reassess the value of some of the accumulated features.</li>
    <li>There are lots of improvements envisaged, but not implemented yet. Some of these emerge from time to time. Suggestions are welcome but (GUI design being the hard discipline that it is) may often be rejected.</li>
    <li>We'd really love to have a Presburger arithmetic oracle. Bernard designed a decision-procedure interface for Jape, but we haven't used it yet.</li>
</ul>

<h3 align="center">Caution</h3>

<p>The present distributions  are of late alpha quality,  in the following
senses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Whilst the main functionality of Jape is present, there are a number of
    slight bugs and omissions  in the user interface. To the best of our
    knowledge the bugs all result in mild irritation to the user, rather than
    death of the application.</li>
  <li>It needs more Unicode characters (particularly in the BAN logic encoding)
    than widely available fonts can deliver. (Roll on STIX ...)</li>
  <li>It lacks up to date documentation. Much of the existing documentation
    of particular theories can, in the proper hands, and with some caution,
    be reused. To the best of our knowledge the interfaces to most of the
    example theories are fully functional.</li>
  <li>We have not retrotested all the distributed theories completely.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>We are, of course, working to remedy these defects.</p>
