The python programs herein support working with a variety of
character encodings.

jape2utf.py:    converts files between encodings -- including the
                nonstandard jape_konstanz and jape_laura encodings.

japeadhoc.py:   reads a file in any encoding, and constructs
                (if possible) an ad-hoc octet-encoding vector for it.
